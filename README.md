# Fault Detection in Solar PV Panels 
This project aims to develop an intelligent and efficient system that leverages artificial intelligence and embedded platforms to automatically detect faults in solar PV panels, ensuring reliable performance and reducing maintenance costs.


## Usage
Our project is implemented with PyTorch framework using Linux operating system


### Environment
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Python = 3.9
- PyTorch = 1.7.1
- OpenCV = 4.5.3 with GPU support

### Jetson Nan setup
For getting a Pre-installed frameworks with GPU support for the Jetson Nano board, download the Jetson Nano image file provided in the following repo: https://github.com/Qengineering/Jetson-Nano-image.git

### Dataset
